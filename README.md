# TFLInfoSite
Website to display TFL Info.

What i plan to do is build a poller which collects data from the TFL api, and stores it in a Mongo Db.
I'll then create a front end for people to view trends and Data based on transport in London.

This data is freely available at https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/our-feeds

For the time being, I'll be using this repo to learn node, as well as learn more front end design.
